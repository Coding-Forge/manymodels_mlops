## Many Models Accelerated Solution with ML Ops
## Azure DevOps
## Github Actions

Please use the [Many Models Solution Accellerator](https://github.com/microsoft/solution-accelerator-many-models) link to download the solution. This repository will make all efforts to keep the many models code up to date I do not guarantee that it will be the latest code. However, you can use the code in the current solution for providing a continuous integration and deployment of your code.

Azure Machine Learning (AML) makes it easy to train, operate, and manage hundreds or even thousands of models. This repo will walk you through the end to end process of creating a many models solution from training to scoring to monitoring.

## Prerequisites

To use this solution accelerator, all you need is access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an [Azure Machine Learning Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace) that you'll create below.

While it's not required, a basic understanding of Azure Machine Learning will be helpful for understanding the solution. The following resources can help introduce you to AML:

1. [Azure Machine Learning Overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/)
2. [Azure Machine Learning Tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup)
3. [Azure Machine Learning Sample Notebooks on Github](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks)
